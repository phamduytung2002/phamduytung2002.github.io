Hello! I'm **Duy-Tung Pham** (/zwi-tuŋ fam/). In Vietnamese, my name is written as *Phạm Duy Tùng*. You can call me **Duy-Tung** or just **Tung** for short!

Currently, I’m an AI Research Resident at [FPT Software AI Center](https://vn.linkedin.com/company/fpt-software-ai-center), where I have the great opportunity to work under the guidance of [Prof. Thieu Vo](https://sites.google.com/tdtu.edu.vn/vongocthieu) and [Prof. Tan Nguyen](https://tanmnguyen89.github.io/).

Before this, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science in Honors Program at  
School of Information and Communication Technology ([SoICT](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/en/)), Hanoi University of Science and Technology ([HUST](https://hust.edu.vn/en/)). During my studies, I was also a research student at the [Data Science Laboratory](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn/), mentored by [Dr. Linh Ngo Van](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/linhnv/) and [Prof. Khoat Than](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq/).
